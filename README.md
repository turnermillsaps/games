# Games Exercises

Purpose of this repository is to practice JS logic, abstraction and rendering using commonly known and simple gaems

## Takeaways

- I could use more practice with abstraction, so if there are some good resources for that specifically, I'd love to use them
- I still need to work through the remainder of these and actually complete them, but I'm on the right track
- The code along for rock-paper-scissors helped with this alot, so I will review that for reference
